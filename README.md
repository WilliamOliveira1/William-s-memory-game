Memory game project

There is a bug that need to be fix when the screen is above 992px

First was used git bash to control version and after was used Git kraken

This is a project used to the Udacity web front-end fundamentals course.

Link for the game:

The star rating is based on the increment of the moves that the player give

On screen above 992px:

if moves < 25 moves = 3 stars
if moves >= 25 and < 50 moves = 2 stars
if moves >= 50 and < 75 moves = 1 stars
if moves >= 75 moves = 0 stars

On screen below 992px:

if moves < 17 moves = 3 stars
if moves >= 17 and < 34 moves = 2 stars
if moves >= 34 and < 51 moves = 1 stars
if moves >= 51 moves = 0 stars

When the game start a modal appears And when the player set all the pairs another modal appears.
